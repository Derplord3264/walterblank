**Part 1: The Blank Page**

*   **Ch 1: Static Cling:** Intro Walter Blank, overqualified and obsessively cleaning a copier at Copy Kingdom, frustrated by subpar work. Hint at a past incident.
*   **Ch 2: Accidental Resolution:** Walter pushes a new printer's limits late at night with a complex image (meth crystals), achieving impossible clarity.
*   **Ch 3: Yo, Mr. Blank! Holy Cow!:** Jesse Printman arrives, sees the print, and is blown away by the quality ("CRISPY!"). Walter feels recognized.
*   **Ch 4: The Inkling:** Walter realizes the crystal structure was key to the quality. He replicates it, feeling a flicker of purpose.
*   **Ch 5: We Need to Print:** Walter awkwardly proposes collaboration to Jesse. Jesse agrees. Their first secret after-hours printing session begins ("Jesse... we need to print.").

**Part 2: Scaling the Stock**

*   **Ch 6: First Impressions:** They produce stunning prints. Jesse shows one off. Walter feels validated. They need better paper.
*   **Ch 7: Sourcing the Glossy:** Walter obsesses over paper specs. Jesse orders the wrong kind, causing tension ("80gsm matte vs 260gsm ultra-premium luster!").
*   **Ch 8: Enter Gustavo Fringe:** Pretentious framer Gustavo Fringe ("Los Pollos Hermanos Frames") sees the resolution, orders prints, critiques "cyan cast."
*   **Ch 9: Magenta Malaise:** Panic prepping Gus's order: "WALTER, WE'RE OUT OF MAGENTA!" Frantic Staples run ensues.
*   **Ch 10: Hank's Hunch:** At a BBQ, BIL Hank (corporate compliance) questions Walt's late nights. Walt's evasiveness and humidity obsession raise mild suspicion.
*   **Ch 11: Heisenprint Rises:** Walter's obsession grows: calibration charts, specific conditions, demanding behaviour ("ambient light temperature!").
*   **Ch 12: The Epson Envy:** Rival shop tries copying them with blurry results. Walt scoffs; Jesse worries.
*   **Ch 13: A Close Collation:** Near discovery during late-night printing (manager or Hank visit). Frantic hiding of evidence.

**Part 3: The Final Proof**

*   **Ch 14: The Exhibitionist Order:** Gustavo orders a large set for a niche exhibition ("Macro Realities"). Biggest job yet.
*   **Ch 15: Pre-Press Panic:** Critical shortage of Walt's specific paper. Arguments over substitutes ("microporous coating!").
*   **Ch 16: Error 5B00 - Fatal Spooling:** Main printer fails (Waste Ink Absorber). Simultaneously, Hank calls about visiting Copy Kingdom tomorrow.
*   **Ch 17: Debugging Desperation (Climax):** Frantic printer repair (tutorials, bypass attempts, cleaning) while racing deadline and hiding evidence from Hank.
*   **Ch 18: Against the Grain:** Manage a desperate fix/use backup printer. Finish job just before Hank's arrival. Exhausted cleanup.
*   **Ch 19: The Critique:** Oblivious Hank visits. Gustavo accepts prints with minor critique ("blacks lack depth"). Walter feels empty.
*   **Ch 20: Fade to Blank:** Months later. Partnership likely dissolved. Jesse back to flyers. Walter alone, still printing micro-details, chasing perfection. Or: a print hangs in Gus's gallery.
